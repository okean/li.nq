  li.nq service offers a very simple but surprisingly useful feature,
  it turns long URL into a tiny one.
</p>

<p>
  I know it's just another TinyURL service, but the goal of reinventing the wheel
  was to learn more about URL shorteners and build a TinyURL, bitly, you name clone in Ruby on Rails
  using Haml, CoffeeScript, SaaS, Redis and all that fancy stuff you know. The project is hosted on
  <a href="https://github.com/okean/li.nq">GitHub</a> so feel free to check it out. And yep, the design
  is build upon <a href="http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/">Twitter Bootstrap</a>.
